*Python scripts used to analyze waveforms from the ATM and upcoming ICESat-2 laser*


### Scripts

* atmFuncs.py*
 - Experimental ATM waveform functions provided by the ATM team (courtesy M. Studinger).

 * atmWaveform.ipynb*
  - iPython Notebook for exploring waveform characterization

All processing in Python 2.7?

Maybe add a list of Python dependencies here? Or even a

### DataOutput

Folder for derived data products.

### DataOutput

Folder for figure outputs.


### Ideas

Look into different waveform classification methods.   
Use Pandas to store and characterize the data.			
Look into Dask library for scaling up the processing.
